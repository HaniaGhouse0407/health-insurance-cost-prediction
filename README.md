Project Title: Health Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview:

This project involves predicting the cost of health insurance based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children. The project will use linear regression as the machine learning algorithm to train the model.

Data Source:

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle, a popular online community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. The dataset contains 1,338 records with 7 columns including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker, region, and charges.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The dataset will be cleaned by removing any missing or invalid data points. The categorical variables will be converted to numerical values using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for linear regression. The dataset will then be split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Building and Training:

The linear regression model will be built using the scikit-learn library in Python. The training set will be used to fit the model and the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model will be trained using various regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation:

The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and mean absolute error. The evaluation results will be visualized using plots to help understand the model's performance.

Conclusion:

This project aims to predict health insurance costs using linear regression. By training the model on a dataset containing various factors that affect insurance costs, it will help insurance companies to make more accurate predictions of future costs.
